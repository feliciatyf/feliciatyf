- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @feliciatyf
- ðŸ‘€ My day job involves Radar Signal Processing and Image Formation. Outside of that I am curious about current developments in Remote Sensing, Antenna Design, and Machine Learning. And outside of that I love a good game of badminton and going on hikes!
- :fire: I am passionate about furthering developments in remote sensing and earth observation for climate related applications and mitigations.
- :speech_balloon: Ask me about Synthetic Aperture Radar, Graph-based Multimodal Data Analysis,and Reflectarray Antennas!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Message me at feliciatyf@gmail.com!
